# Reddit User Subscriber

Are you interested in a particular redditor contributions to a certain subreddit but don't care about what they have to say in others? Me too, that's why I made this bot.

I frequent [r/AndroidDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/), a section of [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) where people share news, articles, libraries and opinions about Android application development. As I got to know the community I started to notice some developers making consistent contributions (e.g [u/JakeWharton](https://www.reddit.com/user/JakeWharton), [u/VasiliyZukanov](https://www.reddit.com/user/VasiliyZukanov) or [u/Zhuinden](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zhuinden)).

While Reddit offers [a function](https://www.reddit.com/r/friends/) similar to Twitter's *follow* there is no easy way to filter a user activity by subreddit so their [r/AndroidDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/) comments got mixed with posts to other communities rendering it useless.

With this bot you can subscribe to multiple redditors of a subreddit and recieve a list of their recent posts and comments directly into your inbox every few days.
